This miracle occurred as she hosted Oliver Cowdery, Joseph Smith, and Joseph’s wife, Emma Smith for an extended time as they finished the Book of Mormon Translation. These guests in addition to her already long to do list, created a significant burden on Mary Whitmer as the hostess. As she went to milk cows she was \"met out near the yard by [an] old man . . . who said to her, ‘You have been very faithful and diligent in your labors, but you are tried because of the increase of your toil. It is proper therefore that you should receive a witness that your faith may be strengthened.’ Thereupon he showed her the plates.\" (account from David Whitmer her son)",

After joining the church she traveled to Kirkland Ohio alone. In 1834 she traveled to Kirtland Ohio alone and married Brigham Young shortly after. He was recently widowed and had two motherless daughters. Brigham often traveled for the church for both missions and regular church service. For about half of their first 5 years of marriage, Brigham was away from home. Brigham's travels often meant heavy work for Mary Ann. She acted as a single parent for their growing family, providing for the family both spiritually and temporally. After returning from another mission in 1841 Brigham realized how impoverished his families condition had become in his absence. A week after Brigham returned, Joseph Smith visited him in his home. He dictated revelation on the stop, now found in Doctrine and Covenants 126. It read: \"dear and well beloved Brother, Brigham Young it is not more required at your hand to leave your family as in times past, for your offering is acceptable to me.\" He was further instructed to \"take special care of your family from this time henceforth and forever.\" This revelation is an unmistakable acknowledgment of Mary Ann's sacrifice and support for their family. Mary Ann continued in her faith and joined the saints in Utah and died in 1882.",

Her faith and trust in the Lord to risk her life for the book of Commandments is inspiring. In her own words Mary had \"been in the church from the beginning. Just six months after it was organized I joined it.\" In fact she attended the first meeting the Prophet Joseph held in Kirtland. Still pretty young she attended this meeting with her mother and it was the first time either of them had seen Joseph Smith. As Mary recalled Joseph \"began to speak very solemnly and very earnestly all at once his countenance changed and he stood mute. Those who looked at him that day said there was a search light within him, over every part of his body. I never saw anything like it on the earth. I could not take my eyes off of him. He got so white that anyone who saw him would have thought he was transparent. I remember I thought I could almost see the bones through the flesh.\" After standing like this for a few minutes, Joseph looked at the congregation and asked if they know who has been in your midst. In response Martin Harris said \"'it was our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.'\" Joseph confirmed this. This experience solidified Mary's testimony of the gospel and in the prophet's words. This experience she had could help explain her courage in defying the mob and rescuing the Book of Commandments.",

After being forced to flee Nauvoo because of religious persecution, the saints sought assistance from the federal government. Before providing help President Polk requested that 500 men volunteer to fight in the Mexican war. This request was very suspicious to many members because of past history with the government. However, Brigham Young asked the saints to comply. Drussila's oldest son William, who was 16 at the time, was asked to volunteer in the Mormon battalion. Drussila depended on her son heavily and it would be quite a sacrifice for her to agree that he join the battalion. After deciding that William wouldn’t go she heard a voice ask her \"Do you not want the highest glory?\" After responding yes, the voice asked \"how do you think to gain it save by making the greatest sacrifices?\" Shortly after the last request for men to join the battalion was sent and William went with the battalion. Her trust in the Lord was tested by this challenge. Although the journey was difficult, the Hendrick family arrived safely in Salt lake city, with William joining them 10 days later.",

In 1887, during a period when Church leaders were routinely encouraging women to receive medical training, Sister Liljenquist was appointed by her bishop to study obstetrics and nursing. She accepted and moved to Salt Lake City for six months, leaving her husband and three children at home in northern Utah during this time. She trained with Dr. Margaret C.

As a nurse and midwife, Sister Liljenquist tended to sick patients and delivered over a thousand babies. She also was the mother of nine children, six of whom she bore after becoming a midwife. Of the relationship between her roles as mother and as midwife, she wrote, “It made my heart ache when I had to leave my babies [her own children] and very often I could hear them crying as I walked down the street, but I had to go with a smile on my face and bring happiness into the sick room, for I have never refused anyone who needed my assistance. . . . You might ask why I left them, but I had been called by the Church to perform this service and I felt that it was a special calling.”",

   "name": "Emmiline B Wells",
   "timePeriod": 4,
   "year": 1877,
   "paragraph": "Emmeline B. Wells, a gifted and incredibly productive writer, served as editor of the Woman’s Exponent, a Latter-day Saint women’s newspaper, from 1877 until the paper was discontinued in 1914. She advocated prominently for women’s suffrage and women’s rights and held many positions in national women’s organizations. Beginning in 1876, Wells also led the Church’s grain storage program, which was designed as a protection against possible food shortages. Eventually the effort culminated in the sale of over 200,000 bushels of Relief Society wheat to the U.S. government during World War I, when Wells was serving as Relief Society general president. While personal lives are not the focus of The First Fifty Years, it is noteworthy that many of the women mentioned in this gallery lived in a wide variety of family situations, many of which were severely challenging. Emmeline B. Wells’s first husband, James Harris, deserted her within two years of the marriage. She then married Newel K. Whitney, a man more than 30 years her senior, as a plural wife. He died five years later, in 1850, leaving her with two young daughters. Two years later she married Daniel H. Wells, who held several demanding community and Church positions and already had six other wives. Emmeline experienced profound loneliness in this marriage, as she and Daniel rarely saw each other until the very last years of Daniel’s life. Daniel died in 1891; Emmeline lived another three decades. The variety and complexity of the challenges faced by these women shows that living the gospel does not immunize us from hardship but can strengthen us in adversity and unite us regardless of individual circumstances. In 1881, Emmeline B. Wells combined a harsh critique of contemporary historical writing with a stunning prediction: “History tells us very little about women; judging from its pages, one would suppose their lives were insignificant and their opinions worthless. . . . Volumes of unwritten history yet remain, the sequel to the written lives of brave and heroic men. But although the historians of the past have been neglectful of woman, and it is the exception if she be mentioned at all; yet the future will deal more generously with womankind, and the historian of the present age will find it very embarrassing to ignore woman in the records of the nineteenth century.” This new book on Latter-day Saint women’s history is undoubtedly one fulfillment of Wells’s prediction.",

Judy served her mission in Queensland, South Africa where she was frequently asked to translate services and other meetings for the Xhosa speaking saints as church leadership in this area only spoke English. After she was married, Judy and her husband moved to Utah. As a young mother, Judy was asked to translate several church publications into Xhosa.
