   "paragraph": "Mary Whitmer was not only the mother to five of the 11 witness of the book of Mormon and the mother-law for two more, but she was also a witness of the Book of Mormon herself. This miracle occurred as she hosted Oliver Cowdery, Joseph Smith, and Joseph’s wife, Emma Smith for an extended time as they finished the Book of Mormon Translation. These guests in addition to her already long to do list, created a significant burden on Mary Whitmer as the hostess. As she went to milk cows she was \"met out near the yard by [an] old man . . . who said to her, ‘You have been very faithful and diligent in your labors, but you are tried because of the increase of your toil. It is proper therefore that you should receive a witness that your faith may be strengthened.’ Thereupon he showed her the plates.\" (account from David Whitmer her son)",

After the mardyrdom of her sons, Lucy wrote a history of her life that was published in 1853. ",

   "paragraph": "Mary Ann Angell joined the church in 1832. Her conversion was particularly influenced by her testimony of the Book of Mormon. After joining the church she traveled to Kirkland Ohio alone. In 1834 she traveled to Kirtland Ohio alone and married Brigham Young shortly after. He was recently widowed and had two motherless daughters. Brigham often traveled for the church for both missions and regular church service. For about half of their first 5 years of marriage, Brigham was away from home. Brigham's travels often meant heavy work for Mary Ann. She acted as a single parent for their growing family, providing for the family both spiritually and temporally. After returning from another mission in 1841 Brigham realized how impoverished his families condition had become in his absence. A week after Brigham returned, Joseph Smith visited him in his home. He dictated revelation on the stop, now found in Doctrine and Covenants 126. It read: \"dear and well beloved Brother, Brigham Young it is not more required at your hand to leave your family as in times past, for your offering is acceptable to me.\" He was further instructed to \"take special care of your family from this time henceforth and forever.\" This revelation is an unmistakable acknowledgment of Mary Ann's sacrifice and support for their family. Mary Ann continued in her faith and joined the saints in Utah and died in 1882.",

After listening to her sisters-in-law's testimony, Sarah read the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants and all the writings from the Latter-Day Saints she could find. She said that it was the \"Doctrine and Covenants that confirmed my faith in the work. I knew that no man, nor set of men, that could make such a book or would dare try from any wisdom that man possess. I knew it was the word of God and a revelation from heaven and received as such. I sought with my whole heart a knowledge of the truth and obtained a knowledge that never has nor never will leave me. \" After receiving a testimony of the Gospel, Sarah struggled to know how to move and join the saints. However, \"I knew the way would be open for us to gather with the saints.\" She and her family took the leap of faith and joined the saints in Kirtland Ohio, 800 miles away. It was only when they arrived that they were able to be baptized.",

   "paragraph": "Mary is best known for saving (with her sister) the soon to be published Book of Commandments when a Mob came and destroyed the Phelp's printing press in 1833. Her faith and trust in the Lord to risk her life for the book of Commandments is inspiring. In her own words Mary had \"been in the church from the beginning. Just six months after it was organized I joined it.\" In fact she attended the first meeting the Prophet Joseph held in Kirtland. Still pretty young she attended this meeting with her mother and it was the first time either of them had seen Joseph Smith. As Mary recalled Joseph \"began to speak very solemnly and very earnestly all at once his countenance changed and he stood mute. Those who looked at him that day said there was a search light within him, over every part of his body. I never saw anything like it on the earth. I could not take my eyes off of him. He got so white that anyone who saw him would have thought he was transparent. I remember I thought I could almost see the bones through the flesh.\" After standing like this for a few minutes, Joseph looked at the congregation and asked if they know who has been in your midst. In response Martin Harris said \"'it was our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.'\" Joseph confirmed this. This experience solidified Mary's testimony of the gospel and in the prophet's words. This experience she had could help explain her courage in defying the mob and rescuing the Book of Commandments.",

This injury paralyzed him for the rest of his life, requiring Drussila to take care of him and the family. After being forced to flee Nauvoo because of religious persecution, the saints sought assistance from the federal government. Before providing help President Polk requested that 500 men volunteer to fight in the Mexican war. This request was very suspicious to many members because of past history with the government. However, Brigham Young asked the saints to comply. Drussila's oldest son William, who was 16 at the time, was asked to volunteer in the Mormon battalion. Drussila depended on her son heavily and it would be quite a sacrifice for her to agree that he join the battalion. After deciding that William wouldn’t go she heard a voice ask her \"Do you not want the highest glory?\" After responding yes, the voice asked \"how do you think to gain it save by making the greatest sacrifices?\" Shortly after the last request for men to join the battalion was sent and William went with the battalion. Her trust in the Lord was tested by this challenge. Although the journey was difficult, the Hendrick family arrived safely in Salt lake city, with William joining them 10 days later.",

When the Saints crossed the plains to Utah, Jane and her young family went with them. Although she could not recieve temple ordinances because of her race, Jane begged the first presidency to allow her to perform proxy baptisms and was granted permission. She was also eventually sealed into Joseph Smith's family as a servant during her lifetime and had her ordinances done by proxy in 1979. ",

   "paragraph": "Emma Anderson Liljenquist is one of hundreds of women and men mentioned in the documents in The First Fifty Years who did not hold prominent leadership positions in the Church. In 1887, during a period when Church leaders were routinely encouraging women to receive medical training, Sister Liljenquist was appointed by her bishop to study obstetrics and nursing. She accepted and moved to Salt Lake City for six months, leaving her husband and three children at home in northern Utah during this time. She trained with Dr. Margaret C. Shipp, a graduate from the Woman’s Medical College in Pennsylvania who had recently started offering midwifery courses in Utah. As a nurse and midwife, Sister Liljenquist tended to sick patients and delivered over a thousand babies. She also was the mother of nine children, six of whom she bore after becoming a midwife. Of the relationship between her roles as mother and as midwife, she wrote, “It made my heart ache when I had to leave my babies [her own children] and very often I could hear them crying as I walked down the street, but I had to go with a smile on my face and bring happiness into the sick room, for I have never refused anyone who needed my assistance. . . . You might ask why I left them, but I had been called by the Church to perform this service and I felt that it was a special calling.”",

   "name": "Emmiline B Wells",
   "timePeriod": 4,
   "year": 1877,
   "paragraph": "Emmeline B. Wells, a gifted and incredibly productive writer, served as editor of the Woman’s Exponent, a Latter-day Saint women’s newspaper, from 1877 until the paper was discontinued in 1914. She advocated prominently for women’s suffrage and women’s rights and held many positions in national women’s organizations. Beginning in 1876, Wells also led the Church’s grain storage program, which was designed as a protection against possible food shortages. Eventually the effort culminated in the sale of over 200,000 bushels of Relief Society wheat to the U.S. government during World War I, when Wells was serving as Relief Society general president. While personal lives are not the focus of The First Fifty Years, it is noteworthy that many of the women mentioned in this gallery lived in a wide variety of family situations, many of which were severely challenging. Emmeline B. Wells’s first husband, James Harris, deserted her within two years of the marriage. She then married Newel K. Whitney, a man more than 30 years her senior, as a plural wife. He died five years later, in 1850, leaving her with two young daughters. Two years later she married Daniel H. Wells, who held several demanding community and Church positions and already had six other wives. Emmeline experienced profound loneliness in this marriage, as she and Daniel rarely saw each other until the very last years of Daniel’s life. Daniel died in 1891; Emmeline lived another three decades. The variety and complexity of the challenges faced by these women shows that living the gospel does not immunize us from hardship but can strengthen us in adversity and unite us regardless of individual circumstances. In 1881, Emmeline B. Wells combined a harsh critique of contemporary historical writing with a stunning prediction: “History tells us very little about women; judging from its pages, one would suppose their lives were insignificant and their opinions worthless. . . . Volumes of unwritten history yet remain, the sequel to the written lives of brave and heroic men. But although the historians of the past have been neglectful of woman, and it is the exception if she be mentioned at all; yet the future will deal more generously with womankind, and the historian of the present age will find it very embarrassing to ignore woman in the records of the nineteenth century.” This new book on Latter-day Saint women’s history is undoubtedly one fulfillment of Wells’s prediction.",

They wanted to join the Saints in the Salt Lake Valley so they booked passage on a ship to San Francisco. William and their son boarded the boat and waited for Elizabeth and her newborn daughter to join them, but found out that Elizabeth's mother had prevented her from boarding the boat. Elizabeth did not let her mother stop her. Instead, she booked passage on the next ship to New York and trekked alone with her daughter across the US. After her daughter's death in Iowa, Elizabeth pressed on with the Willie handcart company and was reunited with her husband and son in Utah. ",

Inspired by Brigham Young's encouragement of women to seek medical training, she enrolled in college at age 16 to prepare for medical school. Martha recieved a chemistry degree from the University of Deseret, a medical degree from the University of Michigan, a pharmaceutical degree from the University of Pennsylvania, and a degree from the National School of Elocution and Oratory in Philadelphia. Martha was married to Angus M. Cannon as a polygamous wife and faced much persecution for this decision due to the national dislike of polygamy. Because of this distaste, the federal governement took away Utah women's right to vote, so Martha became a suffragist. When Utah became a state, its constitution gave women the right to vote, so Martha was first to register and later announced her run for state Senate against her husband. Martha won the senate seat and served one term before retiring and moving to California with her children.  ",

Mexico City was 75 miles to the south, a significant distance for Desideria to travel with her health considerations. Instead her son Jose made the journey. He found Elder James z. Stewart while the missionary was correcting printer's proofs of the tract about which Desideria had dreamed. Though the pamphlet was not yet completed. The missionary sent Jose home with other tracts. After Desideria read the pamphlets, she requested baptism. ",

As a child she befrended her family's servants' children who spoke only Xhosa. As a result Judy learned to speak fluent Xhosa. While studying Xhosa, was approached by missionaries and joined the church. Judy served her mission in Queensland, South Africa where she was frequently asked to translate services and other meetings for the Xhosa speaking saints as church leadership in this area only spoke English. After she was married, Judy and her husband moved to Utah. As a young mother, Judy was asked to translate several church publications into Xhosa. After reviewing selections of the Book of Mormon translated into Xhosa, Judy told the church that they were not accurate. In response, they asked her to translate the Book of Mormon into Xhosa. ",

Prior to this time, no sister missionaries had served in Taiwan. Although she knew receiving leave from her internship was highly unlikely, Chiu asked and was blessed with leave to serve her mission. She and Sister Johnson traveled through Taiwan holding Relief Society meetings. Prior to their service, the Relief Society was being run by elders and was only about a year old. Through her service, the Relief Society became a stable organization run by women. ",

They wanted their family members back home in India to hear about the gospel, so they asked President Spencer W Kimball to send missionaries to India. President Kimball responded by calling Elise and her husband to serve as the first missionaries in India. Although their mission was short, they taught the gospel to over 20 of their family members. Elise was able to help her father who was a preacher in another church, translate the Book of Mormon into Telugu. Because of her efforts, the first stake in India was created in the area they served their mission.",

Rigmor disagreed with him, sharing the persecution that she had faced as a Latter Day Saint in part because of Einar Molland’s book. Instead of being offended, the professor connected her with Einar. When they met, Rigmor told Einar that his research about the church was biased and untrue. Einar listened to Rigmor, who spoke with the power of the spirit and promised to revise his book to be fair to the Saints. ",
