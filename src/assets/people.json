  "name": "Emma Anderson Liljenquist",
  "timePeriod": 4,
  "year": 1887,
  "paragraph": "Emma Anderson Liljenquist is one of hundreds of women and men mentioned in the documents in The First Fifty Years who did not hold prominent leadership positions in the Church. In 1887, during a period when Church leaders were routinely encouraging women to receive medical training, Sister Liljenquist was appointed by her bishop to study obstetrics and nursing. She accepted and moved to Salt Lake City for six months, leaving her husband and three children at home in northern Utah during this time. She trained with Dr. Margaret C. Shipp, a graduate from the Woman’s Medical College in Pennsylvania who had recently started offering midwifery courses in Utah. As a nurse and midwife, Sister Liljenquist tended to sick patients and delivered over a thousand babies. She also was the mother of nine children, six of whom she bore after becoming a midwife. Of the relationship between her roles as mother and as midwife, she wrote, “It made my heart ache when I had to leave my babies [her own children] and very often I could hear them crying as I walked down the street, but I had to go with a smile on my face and bring happiness into the sick room, for I have never refused anyone who needed my assistance. . . . You might ask why I left them, but I had been called by the Church to perform this service and I felt that it was a special calling.”"

  "name": "Emmiline B Wells",
  "timePeriod": 4,
  "year": 1877,
  "paragraph": "Emmeline B. Wells, a gifted and incredibly productive writer, served as editor of the Woman’s Exponent, a Latter-day Saint women’s newspaper, from 1877 until the paper was discontinued in 1914. She advocated prominently for women’s suffrage and women’s rights and held many positions in national women’s organizations. Beginning in 1876, Wells also led the Church’s grain storage program, which was designed as a protection against possible food shortages. Eventually the effort culminated in the sale of over 200,000 bushels of Relief Society wheat to the U.S. government during World War I, when Wells was serving as Relief Society general president. While personal lives are not the focus of The First Fifty Years, it is noteworthy that many of the women mentioned in this gallery lived in a wide variety of family situations, many of which were severely challenging. Emmeline B. Wells’s first husband, James Harris, deserted her within two years of the marriage. She then married Newel K. Whitney, a man more than 30 years her senior, as a plural wife. He died five years later, in 1850, leaving her with two young daughters. Two years later she married Daniel H. Wells, who held several demanding community and Church positions and already had six other wives. Emmeline experienced profound loneliness in this marriage, as she and Daniel rarely saw each other until the very last years of Daniel’s life. Daniel died in 1891; Emmeline lived another three decades. The variety and complexity of the challenges faced by these women shows that living the gospel does not immunize us from hardship but can strengthen us in adversity and unite us regardless of individual circumstances. In 1881, Emmeline B. Wells combined a harsh critique of contemporary historical writing with a stunning prediction: “History tells us very little about women; judging from its pages, one would suppose their lives were insignificant and their opinions worthless. . . . Volumes of unwritten history yet remain, the sequel to the written lives of brave and heroic men. But although the historians of the past have been neglectful of woman, and it is the exception if she be mentioned at all; yet the future will deal more generously with womankind, and the historian of the present age will find it very embarrassing to ignore woman in the records of the nineteenth century.” This new book on Latter-day Saint women’s history is undoubtedly one fulfillment of Wells’s prediction."

  "paragraph": "Grew up in South America on a farm where she was taught about the restored gospel by her Methodist Mother. As a child she befrended her family's servents' children who spoke only Xhosa. As a result Judy learned to speak fluent Xhosa. While studying Xhosa, was approached by missionaries and joined the church. Judy served her mission in Queensland, South Africa where she was frequently asked to translate services and other meetings for the Xhosa speaking saints as church leadership in this area only spoke English. After she was married, Judy and her husband moved to Utah. As a young mother, Judy was asked to translate several church publications into Xhosa. After reviewing selections of the Book of Mormon translated into Xhosa, Judy told the church that they were not accurate. In response, they asked her to translate the Book of Mormon into Xhosa. "

In early 1880, at 66, she dreamed of a pamphlet --Una vox de amonestacion (a voice of warning) being published by latter-day saint missionaries in Mexico City. Mexico City was 75 miles to the south, a significant distance for Desideria to travel with her health considerations. Instead her son Jose made the journey. He found Elder James z.

The missionary sent Jose home with other tracts. After Desideria read the pamphlets, she requested baptism."

  "year": "1778- 1856",
  "paragraph": "Mary Whitmer was not only the mother to five of the 11 witness of the book of Mormon and the mother-law for two more, but she was also a witness of the Book of Mormon herself. This miracle occurred as she hosted Oliver Cowdery, Joseph Smith, and Joseph’s wife, Emma Smith for an extended time as they finished the Book of Mormon Translation. These guests in addition to her already long to do list, created a significant burden on Mary Whitmer as the hostess. As she went to milk cows she was \"met out near the yard by [an] old man . . . who said to her, ‘You have been very faithful and diligent in your labors, but you are tried because of the increase of your toil. It is proper therefore that you should receive a witness that your faith may be strengthened.’ Thereupon he showed her the plates.\" (account from David Whitmer her son)"

After listening to her sisters-in-law's testimony, Sarah read the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants and all the writings from the Latter-Day Saints she could find. She said that it was the \"Doctrine and Covenants that confirmed my faith in the work. I knew that no man, nor set of men, that could make such a book or would dare try from any wisdom that man possess. I knew it was the word of God and a revelation from heaven and received as such. I sought with my whole heart a knowledge of the truth and obtained a knowledge that never has nor never will leave me. \" After receiving a testimony of the Gospel, Sarah struggled to know how to move and join the saints. However, \"I knew the way would be open for us to gather with the saints.\" She and her family took the leap of faith and joined the saints in Kirtland Ohio, 800 miles away. It was only when they arrived that they were able to be baptized."
